The Advantages of a Dual-Extruder Setup with a Secondary Pulling Extruder

A 3D printer’s extruder is a critical component responsible for feeding filament into the hotend, where it is melted and deposited layer by layer to create a print. Typically, a single extruder either pushes or pulls the filament, but adding two extruders in sequence—one pushing and one pulling—unlocks significant performance benefits.

In this setup, the primary extruder pushes the filament forward, while the secondary extruder actively pulls it through the system. This dual-extruder approach dramatically improves filament control, reducing slack, minimizing the chances of under-extrusion, and enabling more precise and consistent material flow.

The Power of the Secondary Pulling Extruder

The secondary extruder plays a crucial role in filament handling. By pulling the filament rather than relying solely on the pushing force of the primary extruder, it:

Reduces filament tension in the Bowden tube or direct drive system

Ensures a steady and uniform filament flow, eliminating skips and jams

Improves extrusion accuracy, leading to cleaner prints and better layer adhesion

By upgrading the secondary extruder with modern extruder gears and a Kraken motor, this setup becomes the most powerful extruder system to date. High-performance gears provide superior grip on the filament, preventing slippage, while the Kraken motor delivers extreme torque, allowing the printer to handle even the toughest and most flexible filaments with ease.

Why This is a Game-Changer

This dual-extruder configuration is particularly beneficial for printing with abrasive, flexible, or high-viscosity materials that are otherwise difficult to manage. With unparalleled filament control, this system ensures smoother extrusion, higher print accuracy, and a more reliable printing experience—making it ideal for both professional and high-performance applications.
